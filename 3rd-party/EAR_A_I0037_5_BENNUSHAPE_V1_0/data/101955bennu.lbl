        Bennu was created by Nolan et al. (2013, in press) based on radar and 
        optical photometric observations made in 1999 and 2005. The model     
        resolution is approximately 25m between vertices, with regions of     
        higher resolution around the location of a topographical 'boulder' and
        the symmetric region in the opposite hemisphere.

        triangular facet. The VERTEX_TABLE is the first part, describing the  
        positions of the vertices of the shape model. The floating point      
        numbers x1 y1 z1 are the coordinates of vertex 1, and so on (vertices 
        are implicitly numbered beginning with 1). The origin is the center of
        mass, and the axes are the principal axes of the shape model. This    
        coordinate system should not be used to define a cartographic system, 
        as the principal axes are not uniquely determined due to the symmetry 
        of the shape. The z-axis is the spin axis or positive pole. The units 
        are kilometers. The linking of vertices into facets is provided in the
        FACET_TABLE. "
