    Asteroid (101955) Bennu was discovered in September 1999 by the LINEAR    
    survey and designated 1999 RQ36. It is an Apollo Near-Earth Object (NEO)  
    with a semi-major axis of 1.126 AU, an eccentricity of 0.205 and an       
    orbital inclination of 6 degrees.  Bennu has a mean diameter of 492 meters
    (uncertainty: 20 meters) and a sidereal rotation period of 4.29746 hours  
    (uncertainty: 0.002 hours).                                               
                                                                              
    Bennu is a B-type asteroid characterized by a linear, featureless spectrum
    with bluish to neutral slope at visible wavelengths. Spectral analysis    
    suggests that the most likely meteorite analogs for Bennu are the CI or CM
    meteorites (Clark et al., 2011).                                          
                                                                              
    This shape model of asteroid (101955) Bennu was created by Nolan et al.   
    (2013) based on radar and optical photometric observations made in 1999   
    and 2005. The model resolution is approximately 25 meters between         
    vertices, with regions of higher resolution around the location of a      
    topographical 'boulder' and the symmetric region in the opposite          
    hemisphere.                                                               
                                                                              
    The model has the format

    where the letter 'v' denotes a vertex and the letter 'f' denotes a        
    triangular facet. The VERTEX_TABLE is the first part, describing the      
    positions of the vertices of the shape model. The floating point numbers  
    x1 y1 z1 are the coordinates of vertex 1, and so on (vertices are         
    implicitly numbered beginning with 1). The origin is the center of mass,  
    and the axes are the principal axes of the shape model. The z-axis is the 
    spin axis or positive pole. The units are kilometers. The linking of      
    vertices into facets is provided in the FACET_TABLE.                      
                                                                              
    The Asteroid (101955) Bennu Shape Model - 101955bennu.tab - file is       
    equivalent to the wavefront or .obj format. The file can be opened by     
    software such as Blender, MATLAB, JSC3D, or CAD programs, and can read    
    directly by most 3D printing services.  A variety of free .obj viewers are
    available for download online.

  =========================                                                   
    There exists some north-south symmetry in surface features of Benu.       
    Because of the nearly-equatorial viewing geometry, this is an artifact of 
    the radar data, and the varying degree of symmetry in different parts of  
    the object may result from variable rotational coverage.                  
                                                                              
    As the asteroid rotates, the points on the equator move across the radar  
    images, but points at the rotation pole remain motionless (Green, 1968).  
    As a result, the Z dimension of the asteroid is less well determined than 
    the X- and Y-dimensions: 'squeezing' the model in the Z direction does not
    change the radar images much.                                             
                                                                              
    This coordinate system should not be used to define a cartographic system,
    as the principal axes are not uniquely determined due to the symmetry of  
    the shape in terms of longitude.                                          
                                                                              
    Uncertainties reported are 1-sigma, but for the shape parameters are      
    conservative and somewhat subjective.  Formal errors in the X- and Y-     
    directions are of 10 meters, and in the Z-axis, 52 meters."
