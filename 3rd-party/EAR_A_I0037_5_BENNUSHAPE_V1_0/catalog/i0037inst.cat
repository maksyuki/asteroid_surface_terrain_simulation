    The Arecibo Planetary Radar combines a transmitter with 1 MW continuous   
    output power and a bandwidth of 27 MHz (1-dB), with a single-pixel        
    receiver. The transmitter can range-code the transmitted signal at up to a
    20 MHz bandwidth, for a range resolution as fine as 50 ns, or 7.5 m."
