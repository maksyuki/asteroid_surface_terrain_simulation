    The Goldstone Solar System Radar transmits 450 kW and can range-code the  
    transmitted signal at up to 40 MHz bandwidth for a range resolution of 25 
    ns or 3.75 m.  The transmit frequency is 8560 MHz (3.5 cm).  Goldstone can
    also be phase, frequency, and amplitude modulated.  Goldstone is fully    
    steerable and can view the entire sky north of declination = -35 degrees. 
    Until 2010, X-band transmissions could be modulated at 8 MHz for 18.75    
    meter resolution."
