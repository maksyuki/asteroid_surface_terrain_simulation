bennu.pdf -  "Bennu shape model showing the views along the principal axes",  
        The shape of Bennu showing the views along the principal axes. Some of
        the apparent north-south symmetry is a model artifact from the        
        near-equatorial viewing geometry. The 'boulder' feature is actually in
        the southern hemisphere.
